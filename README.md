### Created a DCF ( Discounted Cash Flow Model ) for Dabur to find its Intrinsic Value

Discounted Cash Flow Model, or “DCF Model”, is a type of financial model that values a company by forecasting its cash flows and discounting them to arrive at a current, present value.A DCF model estimates a company’s intrinsic value (the value based on a company’s ability to generate cash flows) and is often presented in comparison to the company’s market value.The DCF approach requires that we forecast a company’s future cash flows and discount them to the present in order to arrive at a present value for the company. That present value is the amount investors should be willing to pay (the company’s value)

### Tasks Performed :

•	Modeled Financial Projections for the company with underlying details around Revenue, Costs, Assets and other line items to compute its Intrinsic Value 

•	Conducted Ratio Analysis (Profitability, Turnover, Liquidity Ratios) to reveal insights regarding operational efficiency and solvency

•	Supported the model with a Working Capital Schedule to gauge the company’s overall health
